<h2 id="enjoy"> <font color="gray" > I started off this ASAC program with no prior formal knowledge in programming. By the end of the course, I will have a clearer understanding of what programming is about and the almost limitless things one can do with programming. I am also confident to say now that learning a set of new skills that are not related to my feild of study  is something absolutely do-able. </font> </h2>
